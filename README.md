# Hubleys

## Hubleys - Brave New Dashboard

So you run a bunch of self-hosted services for multiple users but are tired of handing out links? No problem, Hubleys got you covered.

- separate dashboard per user, according to their groups/permissions
- all dashboard contents are predefined by the admin
- dashboard features:
    - link tiles, organized by folders
    - search engines with autocomplete
    - upcoming calendar events
- customizable & dynamic backgrounds
- current weather & forecast
- clock, stopwatch, timer

## Quick Demo

```shell
docker run -it --rm -e DEMO_MODE=1 -e ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 -p3000:3000 ghcr.io/knrdl/hubleys-dashboard:edge
```

> Weather and unsplash backgrounds won't work in demo.

| `/data/config.yml`         | ðŸ—Ž   | â˜‘        | system config file (can be readonly)                                                                                      |

## 2. Configure Hubleys

Edit the contents of `/data/config.yml`. The demo example can be found [here](./docs/config.yml).

## 3. Configure reverse proxy and auth provider:

Hubleys uses forward auth (also known as webproxy auth) to get all relevant user info via http header:

- **Remote-User**: unique userID, must be present
- **Remote-Groups**: comma seperated group memberships
- **Remote-Name**: optional display name
- **Remote-Email**: optional email addr

See also: [Authelia docs](https://www.authelia.com/integration/trusted-header-sso/introduction/#response-headers)

Using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as reverse proxy a config may look like below:

```
hubleys.example.org {
	forward_auth authelia:9091 {
		method GET
		uri /api/verify?rd=https://login.example.org
		header_up X-Forwarded-Method {method}
		header_up X-Forwarded-Uri {uri}
		copy_headers Remote-User Remote-Groups Remote-Name Remote-Email
	}
	
	reverse_proxy hubleys:3000
}
```

As auth provider [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) can be used.

## 4. I need more icons

Please have a look here (thanks @FieldofClay):
* https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons
* https://simpleicons.org/
* https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign

You can download additional icons into the `/data/logos` folder or just reference them via url in the `config.yml`
